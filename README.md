# odin-recipes

This project is meant to highlight basic skills of
HTML to create a small website with relative links
to completed recipes. Notable additions include
images, use of different headers, and lists. 

The finished product consists of a "home" website that
contains links to other websites that have recipes
for three separate dishes.
