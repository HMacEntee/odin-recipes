    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This dish was first created by Aunt Laura as a
        way to cook food for the family while being able
        to do work around the house while it cooked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since its creation, the dish has been a hit with
        the family and is a favorite meal. The recipe
