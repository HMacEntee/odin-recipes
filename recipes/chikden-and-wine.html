    <h1>Aunt Laura's Chicken and Wine</h1>

    <img src="chickenandwine.jpg" height="500">

    <p>
        Aunt Laura's chicken and wine was created to
        address the surplus of white wine that Aunt
        Laura had in her liquor cabinet. She much
        preferred to drink red wine, and thus white
        wine was reserved for cooking purposes.
